Automated Plant Disease Classifier with Adaptive Fertilizer Recommendations
A powerful tool designed to assist farmers in identifying plant diseases and receiving tailored fertilizer recommendations. This application uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict diseases from uploaded leaf images and provides adaptive fertilizer suggestions based on the results.

📋 Features
Plant Disease Detection: Upload a leaf image to detect common plant diseases using a trained CNN model.
Fertilizer Recommendations: Get customized fertilizer suggestions to enhance plant recovery and productivity.
Error Handling: Ensures only valid leaf images are processed. Provides clear error messages for invalid uploads.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive experience.
